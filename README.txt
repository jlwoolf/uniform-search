Structure:
  All files inside the include directory. There are two header files which define two node types: MapNode and TreeNode. MapNode is used for representing a node from the map loaded from the input file. TreeNode is used when branching out on the uniform-search algorithm.

Compilation and Execution:
  To compile, execute "make" in the directory. This will create the find_route program in the same directory from which execution can be preformed. Running is exactly as specified:
  
  ./find_route input_filename origin_city destination_city
